# BandsInTown Challenge

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
The project requires:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - a javascript runtime built using Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine. The project requires at least version 6+. You can check if you have Node.js using the following command on your terminal or download it using the previous link:
```
node -v
```
* NPM or Yarn
  * NPM is a package manager installed with Node.js, so if you have Node.js installed, then you should also got NPM. You can check you NPM version using the following command:
```
npm -v
```
  * You can use Yarn as a substitute to NPM. Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook, Google, Exponential, and Tilde. It is said to be safer and faster then NPM.
You can download it on [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). On the other hand, if you have it installed, you can check Yarn's version using the following command:
```
yarn version
```
